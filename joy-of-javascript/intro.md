# Introduction

## Preface

- learned programming in uni with class based langauges like Java
- when he came across JS he thought it was an abomination
- soon realized that JS was built from the ground up as OOP
- got excited about higher-order functions, functional programming, and composable software
- this book will teach you the beauty behind JS quirks like prototypes, closures, and higher-order functions

## About this book

- a lot of JS info floating on the web
- this book focuses on the cutting-edge that will put you ahead of the curve
- how OOP is in the prototype chains and dynamic linkings
- higher-order functions lead to composable software
- static and dynamic separation of concerns with modules and metaprogramming
- handling async flow of data effectively

### the book's audience

- professionals who already work w/ JS
- therefore, intermediate and advanced
- nevertheless, fine for beginners who want to learn more

### this book's organization

- this book's goal is to teach you to build software from simple, composable pieces
- each chapter (9) and each section (4) builds on the previous one (mastery learning)

#### 1. Objects

- JavaScript’s object system
- syntactical support for class declaration = easy inheritance, encapsulation and structure
- nevertheless, JS is NOT a class oriented language
- JS is an object oriented language
- therefore, in-depth look at the object system in JS
- how to use it well

#### 2. Functions

- now that we know about objects, we can string them together w/ functions
- JS is perfect for functional programming, i.e. functions as the main engine
- higher-order functions are the key to writing modular, composable, and maintainable software, the strongest feature of JS
- how to use FP (functional programming) to drive business logic of your app forward
- using higher-order functions as the focal point for youisr design

#### 3. Code

- for a long time, JS did not have official module support
- ES6 finally brought it
- modules are used to separate reusable pieces of code
- JS's standard API `Proxy` and `Reflect` help with this as well
- learn to make sharp separations in your code base

#### 4. Data

- modern web has everything API-driven
- therefore, learn to use JS's async capabilities to their highest potential
