# Preface

## Who Should Read This Book

- intermediate web devs
- looking to get into server-side programming
- want to build modern PHP websites

## Programming Has Changed

- security is a lot more important now (bots/scripts are running rampant)
- both PHP and mySQL are stronger languages w/ more capabilities
- at the same time, more difficult to learn due to all the new additions

## It Takes 10,000 Hours to Become an Expert

- after this book, fundamentals will be covered
- will be able to do 90% of what you want
- nevertheless, must put the fundamentals to use
- the more advanced techniques/concepts are more for making your code more efficient/faster/easier to maintain
- for now, only focus on making things that work
- reformatting comes much, much later when you have experience

## Resist the Temptation to Skip Ahead

- programming concepts build on top of each other
- therefore, you must know what comes before in order to know what comes ahead

## The Concorde Fallacy

- aka sunk cost fallacy
- you will run into errors/bugs & will have to start from scratch
- maintain presistance
- eventually you'll come up with solutions and write better code
- moments of errors/mistakes will teach you
- keep a git repo of your projects so you may see how they evolve

## You’re Not Learning PHP

- you are learning how to code
- universal concepts will be taught
- these are applicable to any other programming language
- concepts > syntax
- syntax changes; the concepts do not

## PHP Syntax

- the syntax is easy
- writing the logic is the hard part
- will have to be able to break problems into smaller components

## You Won’t Get Anything Done by Planning

- general advice: plan out your code before coding
- this books advice: ignore that
- why? you need to know the tools and the problems they solve before being able to design software
- i.e. hit the ground running by coding first
- example: building a blueprint for a house but not knowing what a hammer does
- designing software first should not be a concern until you are proficient in coding
