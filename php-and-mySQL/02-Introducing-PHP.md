# Introducing PHP

## Introduction

- PHP is a server-side language
- it allows you to embed dynamically generated content into the HTML code of a web page
- client-side languages like HTML are executed by the web browser after it has downloaded it
- server-side languages like PHP is executed by the web server which happens before the web browser execution
  - i.e. PHP is a server-side language b/c it does its work on the **server**, not the browser
- this is how/why PHP can affect how the web page looks like
- therefore, the HTML file the browser recieves has already had its content changed by the PHP script

## How PHP Works

- like JS, PHP is embedded into an HTML file by using the opening tag `<?php` and the closing tag `?>`
- if an HTML file contains any PHP, it must use the file extension `.php` instead of `.html`
- this is so b/c the web browser does not know how to execute PHP
- so if a file ends with `.php`, the browser says, "hey web server, take care of this and translate it back for me in regular HTML"

## Our First PHP Script

- remember that `wow.html` you made in the last lesson?
- open it back up in a text editor
- paste this

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Wow! Check this out!</h1>
    <p>
      This number was generated by PHP:
      <strong>
        <?php
   	     echo rand(1, 10);
   	    ?>
      </strong>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- the PHP code is within the strong tags
- now resave that file as `wow.php` and refresh it
  - change the url to `mysite.v.je/wow.php`
- voila, your first PHP script
- everytime you refresh the page, a new number will be generated btw/ 1 to 10
