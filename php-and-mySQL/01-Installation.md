# Installation

## Introduction

- you build a static site with HTML, CSS and maybe JS files
- you need to upload them to a webserver so people can access it via the internet
- PHP is for the web server
- allows you to write scripts to make your website dynamic, e.g. populating the website with up-to-date info from a database
- in other words, PHP works with the web server to generate dynamic websites
- therefore, PHP requires a database with which to work
- we will build this database w/ mySQL

## Your Own Web Server

- to test your own PHP/mySQL combo, you need your own web server that supports both
- instead of uploading the changes to your web host to see them, you can do this on your computer much like the live server extension
- therefore, a huge time saver during development
