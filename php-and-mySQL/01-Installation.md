## Introduction

- you build a static site with HTML, CSS and maybe JS files
- you need to upload them to a webserver so people can access it via the internet
- PHP is for the web server
- allows you to write scripts to make your website dynamic, e.g. populating the website with up-to-date info from a database
- therefore, PHP requires a database with which to work
- we will build this database w/ mySQL
