# 01. The Essentials of Responsive Web Design

## The browser and device landscape

Before the iPhone of 2007, websites were built at a fixed width for desktop monitors and laptops.

As soon as the mobile market increased in 2012, some people on the cutting edge of web development wanted to design websites with mobile users in mind.

Today, in 2022, mobile users are in the majority of users on the internet.

Thankfully, with responsive designs, we can make sure our websites look good on almost any device.

## Core Principles

1. the viewport meta tag that makes sure the pixels are taken from the physical device

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />
```

2. using responsive units like `%` and `vh, vw`

3. restricting the size of elements with `max-width`

4. media queries

5. breakpoints

6. mobile first approach
