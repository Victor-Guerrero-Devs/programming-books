# 05. Grid Layout

## What is Grid?

- a recent layout tool in CSS that lets us make the macro layout of your web page 
- was still a thing before the official CSS Grid but done through painful hacks 
- now very easy to use thanks to official support
- main idea is that we define the size of columns and rows inside of them 
- we change the width of the columns in relation to viewport width
