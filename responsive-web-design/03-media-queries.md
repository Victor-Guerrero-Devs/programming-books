## viewport meta tag

When Apple released the iPhone in 2007, they introduced a new `meta` tag for the viewport to allow webpages to adjust themselves for mobile browsers.

`<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />`

As long as you have that line in your `head` element, responsive design will be a breeze because it takes the physical pixels of the device into account.
