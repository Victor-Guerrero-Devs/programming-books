# 05. Working with Color

## HSL

- HSL is king
- ditch hex and rgb/a

## Color Palette

- only need 3 colors: grey, primary, accent
- naturally for all 3, provide different shades
- this will give you a diverse yet tight color scheme and not rainbow puke
- lastly, you will need red (for negative states like delete), yellow (for warnings), and gree (for good stuff) should your UI need such things

## Don't rely on color alone

- Users with color blindness may have difficulty interpreting the UI if color is the only means of communication.
- Instead, designers can use other means to communicate information, such as adding icons to indicate positive or negative changes. In cases where different colors are necessary, contrast can be used instead.
- Color should support design and not be the only thing that communicates
