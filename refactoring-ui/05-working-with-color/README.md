# 05. Working with Color

## HSL

- HSL is king
- ditch hex and rgb/a

## Color Palette

- only need 3 colors: grey, primary, accent
- naturally for all 3, provide different shades
- this will give you a diverse yet tight color scheme and not rainbow puke
- lastly, you will need red (for negative states like delete), yellow (for warnings), and gree (for good stuff) should your UI need such things
