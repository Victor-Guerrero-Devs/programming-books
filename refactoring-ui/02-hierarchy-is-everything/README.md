# 02. Hierarchy is Everything

## Not all elements are equal

- visual hierarchy is the most important thing when it comes to producing great designs
- the purpose is to make the important things pop out with size and color and downplaying the secondary and tertiary details by decreasing size and muting the color

## Size isn’t everything

- using font-size alone to establish hierarchy is not smart
- instead, you should incorporate color and font-weight as well
- this way you don't have have extremly huge headings and small body text
- you headings can be medium sized with a thicker weight and brighter color to pop out instead of relying on font-size alone
- stick to 2 or 3 colors at most, e.g. dark gray for headings, medium gray for regular text, light gray for copyright
- 600-700 font-weight for headings, 400-500 for regular text
- never dip below 400; use a lighter color or smaller font-size instead

## Don’t use grey text on colored backgrounds

- use it only if you have a white background
- if you are trying to de-emphasize text, give it a lighter color/opacity of the background it has, e.g. if a blue background, give it a very light blue font color
