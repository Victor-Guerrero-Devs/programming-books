# 03. Layout & Spacing

## Start with whitespace

- initial designs should have a lot of whitespace
- as you start to clean it up, you should REMOVE it, not ADD it
- it is much easier to remove than add it to achieve good designs
- only time you should start with little whitespace is with dashboards were a lot of info is compacted
