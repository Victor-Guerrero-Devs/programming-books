# 04. Designing Text

## Establish a type scale

- build a consistent system for sizing your text (again tailwind already has this created)
- if building your own, avoid `em`; only use `px` or `rem`

## Use good fonts

- choose popular ones, i.e. social proof via Google fonts
- make sure it has at least 5 weights
- imitate from those who know better
