# 01. Starting from Scratch

## Start with a feature, not a layout

You should begin designing, not with the overall layout, but with a specific component. Say you are building a UI for an Airline for booking flights. Therefore, you should start with a specific component like the search bar for flights.

This way you avoid over-designing or adding unneeded styles.
