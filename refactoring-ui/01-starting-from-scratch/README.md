# 01. Starting from Scratch

## Start with a feature, not a layout

You should begin designing, not with the overall layout, but with a specific component. Say you are building a UI for an Airline for booking flights. Therefore, you should start with a specific component like the search bar for flights.

• A field for the departure city
• A field for the destination city
• A field for the departure date
• A field for the return date
• A button to perform the search

This way you avoid over-designing or adding unneeded styles.

## Detail comes later

- don't get bogged down with low-level design decisions like typefaces and colors in the early stages of designing a new feature
- the focus should be on exploring layout ideas and creating a clear interface with a strong hierarchy
- you should beging with paper and pen instead
- low-fidelity designs like sketches and wireframes are disposable and should be used to explore ideas before moving on to building the real thing
