## Emulate a light source

- how to create a raised or inset effect in user interfaces by emulating the way light interacts with objects in the real world. For raised elements, make the top edge slightly lighter and add a small dark box shadow below to simulate blocking of light.
- For inset elements, make the bottom edge slightly lighter and add a small dark inset box shadow above to simulate blocking of light. However, one should avoid overdoing the effect and making interfaces too busy or unrealistic.
