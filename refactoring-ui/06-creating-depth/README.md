# 06. Creating Depth

## Emulate a light source

- how to create a raised or inset effect in user interfaces by emulating the way light interacts with objects in the real world. For raised elements, make the top edge slightly lighter and add a small dark box shadow below to simulate blocking of light.
- For inset elements, make the bottom edge slightly lighter and add a small dark inset box shadow above to simulate blocking of light. However, one should avoid overdoing the effect and making interfaces too busy or unrealistic.

## Use shadows to convey elevation

- Small shadows are suitable for elements that should not dominate the page, while larger shadows are ideal for capturing the user's attention.
- Establishing a fixed set of shadows will speed up the design process and maintain consistency. Shadows can also be used to provide visual cues during interaction with elements, such as making a button feel like it's being pressed into the page when clicked.
- Focus on where they want an element to sit on the z-axis and assign a shadow accordingly.
