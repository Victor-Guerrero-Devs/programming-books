# 01. Overview of Gatsby

## History of Static Web

Static sites are the original blueprint for any website using HTML, CSS, and JS.
CMSes were created to allow non-technical users to control a webpage's design and content, but they can be clunky and slow.
Frontend frameworks and libraries, such as React.js, have gained notoriety and have drastically sped up workflows.
However, combining frontend frameworks with CMSs can lead to security and bottleneck issues, leading to the rebirth of static sites.
Gatsby was created by Kyle Mathews, who identified gaps in existing tooling and wanted to create an ideal product for website accessibility and performance.
Static content is unbeatable in terms of speed and performance.
